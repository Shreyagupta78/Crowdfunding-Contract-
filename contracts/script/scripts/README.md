# Crowdfunding Contract

## Project Description
This project implements a decentralized crowdfunding platform using Solidity. It allows project creators to set fundraising goals and deadlines, while contributors can send ETH to support the campaign.

## Project Vision
Empower communities to raise funds transparently without relying on centralized platforms. The system ensures contributors get refunds if the fundraising goal isn't achieved.

## Key Features
- Time-bound crowdfunding with customizable duration
- Refunds issued automatically if the campaign fails
- Owner-only withdrawals after successful campaigns
- Real-time tracking of fundraising progress and status

## Future Scope
- Add milestone-based fund releases
- Integrate with front-end dApps for real-time contribution dashboards
- Add support for ERC20 tokens instead of just ETH
- Implement contribution tiers and perks
